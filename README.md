# 📜 Challenge Overview:
Your task is to build a file server with as many of the following characteristics as you can manage:
- [ ] File management: The server should support basic file storage and retrieval.
- [ ] Authentication: Provide options for protected and auth-less files
- [ ] Encryption: Include functionality to encrypt and decrypt files during storage or transfer
- [ ] Access: The file server should be accessible via a web application that runs on a Linux server.
<br><sub><sub>(Latest stable version of Debian, Fedora, or Ubuntu. Please specify in your submission.)</sub></sub><br>
<br>

# 🛠 Rules and Requirements:
- Teams:
  - This challenge is designed for single devs. Duos will be allowed but will be rated accordingly to keep it fair. If we find more than two contributors towards code (if they merely fix your readme typos its whatever), then we will disqualify you.

- Project Scale:
  - The challenge is designed to exhaust full working days where possible. Focus on a small-to-medium scope for the project.

- Code Standards:
  - The project must be your original work.
  - Do NOT use excessive AI. It's okay if you let it write some small helper function; we would too. But keep it minimal; we will run some checks. 
  - Use Python, JS, Rust, or Go, and try to keep dependencies minimal.
  - Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

- Supported Protocols:
  - Bonus points for implementing WebDAV or other file transfer protocols.
  - Compatibility with Windows tools is encouraged but not mandatory.

- Submission:
  - Fork this repository and submit your work as a pull request <b>after renaming the branch to your USERNAME</b>. This way we can accept all valid PRs after the time is up, so future users can browse submissions.
  - Include a detailed README in your project folder explaining your approach, setup instructions, and any assumptions made.
  - We will contact the winner(s) either through github PR messages, or on Discord, whichever happens to work out for you.

- Deadline:
  - <b>All submissions must be made by `Dec. 23rd 23:59:59 PM UTC`.</b>
<br>

# 🛡️ Disqualification grounds:
There are, of course, ways to get disqualified; let's get through them.
- Working as a >2 person team. Once again, this is designed for individuals or duos at best; else it would be too simple.
- Stealing/skidding code, or any other wording thereof. We want to see *your* code, not someone else's.
- Submitting after the deadline. Even a second, if the date says 24th (UTC), you're out. Be on time.
- Trying to find loopholes in the rules.
- `More will be added if needed.`
<br>

# ✨ Judging Criteria:
Submissions will be evaluated on the following, in this exact order:

| Criteria      |    Description                                                                                         |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functionality | Does the server meet the required functionality? Are all features working?                             |
| Performance   | How well does the server perform under typical use cases?                                              |
| Dependancies  | How many godforsaken libraries do we have to be concerned about having vulnerabilities we can't patch? |
| Code Quality  | Is the code clean, maintainable, and well-documented?                                                  |
| Innovation    | Bonus points for creativity and implementing optional features like WebDAV.                            |
| Design        | Is the architecture thoughtful? Is it scalable and efficient?                                          |

<sub>By the way, <b>we know</b> that 18 days for all of this is not a lot, especially during the holiday season, etc. <b>This is on purpose</b>! We want to see your ability to prioritize and see how you handle time constraints. We are the unreasonable manager you have to satisfy, but don't worry; we won't deduct points for missing things. You start at 0, and the only way is up!</sub><br>
